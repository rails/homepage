    <p>
      Rails is committed to fostering a welcoming community. If you encounter any unacceptable behavior,
      follow these steps to report the issue to the core team. We are here to help.
    </p>

    <p>
      As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest of
      fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people
      who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating
      documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free
      experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender
      identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance,
      body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.
    </p>

    <p>
      Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>The use of sexualized language or imagery</li>
      <li>Personal attacks</li>
      <li>Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments</li>
      <li>Public or private harassment</li>
      <li>Publishing other's private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission</li>
      <li>Other unethical or unprofessional conduct.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The Rails core team have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
      reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
      that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct.
    </p>

    <p>
      We commit to fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect
      of managing this project. Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the
      Code of Conduct may be permanently removed from the project team.
    </p>

    <p>
      This code of conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
      when an individual is representing the project or its community.
